# Recursive functions

This is my demonstration of two different recursive functions. There is a Fibonacci Sequence generator and a random array sorter that uses a MergeSort algorithm.

## Technologie used

I built this web app using HTML, SASS, TypeScript and Webpack.

## Functionality

The user enters a number between 1 and 1000 into the Fibonacci Generator and a sequence with that many elements is displayed. The user enters a number between 1 and 1000 into the Random Array Sorter and an array with random integers between 1 and 100 is displayed, along with a sorted (low to high) version of that same array.
